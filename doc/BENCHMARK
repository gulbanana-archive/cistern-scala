3x Dell PowerEdge 1750 database servers (master, slave, dev-or-titan) 
2x Dell PowerEdge 1750 app servers - static pages, redirects to titan vm
2x vms on 1x Dell PE2950; titan? and memcached 10GB db
30 GB of search indexes for nonarchived posts
1x "dev server" in there somewhere

SA FORUMS - SIZE
peak 2000 concurrent requests (vs state-of-db)
peak of 16000 concurrent sessions (cookied)
peak 6k sessions in one forum (D&D during debates; this crashed the forums)
130 million posts in archives 
6 million live posts in 40 thousand live threads
235k posts/week
peak 40k posts/day
173k registered users

RAW PLAY - no db connections
ab -c 500 -k -r -n 30000 localhost:9000/board/hello
Requests per second:    3589.76 [#/sec] (mean)
Time per request:       139.285 [ms] (mean)
Time per request:       0.279 [ms] (mean, across all concurrent requests)
Transfer rate:          5851.66 [Kbytes/sec] received
99% requests in <= 250 ms

the (ridiculous) goal is to achieve throughput similar to SA with actual forum software running.
